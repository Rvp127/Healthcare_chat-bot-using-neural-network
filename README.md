# Healthcare_chat-bot-using-neural-network
1 - This code is for understanding how a healthcare chatbot works while being provided with symptoms from the user
2 - This also gives  converstion interaction between the user and the bot
3 - To follow the code refer the python file and to understand the methodology please read the project report
4 - *NOTE* the important part of this code is the 'intents.json' file which is the main reason the bot responds to the users demands. The indentation mentioned in the       json file is important to follow as it suits the way how the code works
Hope this gives some understanding on how chatbots work with neural networks...THANK YOU!
